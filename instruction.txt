anisble-config list #Lists all the configurations

anisble-config view #Shows the current/active config file

anisble-config dump #Shows current setting of vairable

ex:-
anisble-config dump|grep GATHERING


ansible-config --version       
In this case I had no configuration file (config file = None) so I generated an empty one (option --disabled means all entries are commented out) in the current directory with

% ansible-config init --disabled > ansible.cfg
